### What are design patterns?

A `design pattern` is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. 

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

### Types of design patterns?
- `Creational design patterns` - Concerned with creation of an object. Creational design patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- `Structural design patterns` - tell how to structure our classes or code bases. Focuses on decoupling interface and implementation of classes and its objects. 
- `Behavioral design patterns` - how the classes will communicate with each other in a loosely coupled manner.
